# Guards

Are used to control the routing behavior based on certain conditions. They can be applied to routes to determine whether a user is allowed to navigate to or leave a particular route.


Guards can be used to enforce authentication requirements for certain routes,

# example
AuthGuard that checks if a user is authenticated before allowing access to a protected route. If the user is not authenticated, the guard can redirect them to the login page or display an access denied message.
