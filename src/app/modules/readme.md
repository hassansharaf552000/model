# Modules

This folder contains the application's Modules

Modules are a way to organize and structure the application into cohesive blocks of functionality.
They serve as containers for various parts of your application, such as components, directives, pipes, services, and other Angular artifacts. Modules help in managing the complexity of large-scale applications by encapsulating related functionality and providing clear boundaries between different parts of the application.
